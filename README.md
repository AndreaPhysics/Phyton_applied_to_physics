# Phyton_applied_to_physics
This project's aim is to show my programming abilities by solving multiple challenges related with important physic topics

*I have started this project being a physics undergraduate, the main idea is to keep updating this project so that this becomes part of my portfolio to showcase my skills in mathematical modeling, Python programming, computational physics and problem resolution.*

## Newman's book: Computational Physics with Python
This project begins thanks to this book by Mark Newmann. I'll be solving many of its challenges to show my abilities in different areas of Python programming and just because of mere selfinterest in the physics background.
