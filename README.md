# Phyton_applied_to_physics
This project's aim is to show my programming abilities by solving multiple challenges related with important physics topics

*I have started this project being a physics undergraduate, the main idea is to keep updating it so that this becomes part of my portfolio to showcase my skills in mathematical modeling, Python programming, computational physics and problem resolution.*

## Newman's book: Computational Physics with Python
This project begins thanks to this book by Mark Newmann. I'll be solving many of its challenges to show my abilities in different areas of Python programming and just because of mere selfinterest in the physics background.

## Other programms
Not only I'll be solving Newman's book challenges but I'll also update some programms of my own or inspired by other books or topics treated in my university physics classes.
